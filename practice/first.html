        <h2>Who Are They !?!?</h2>
        <div>The Avengers are a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, 
            created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. 
            The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (cover-dated September 1963). 
            Labeled "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", the original Avengers consisted of Iron Man, Ant-Man, Hulk, 
            Thor and the Wasp. Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, 
            and joined the group after they revived him.</div><br>
        <p class="g">The Avengers are an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from the Marvel Comics portfolio. 
            Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently 
            but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle especially formidable villains. 
            This in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, 
            whose characters were created specifically to be part of their team,
            with the team being central to their identity.</p>
